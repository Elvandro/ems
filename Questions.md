# Employee Management System

# Question 1
I was not able to meet the search by department functionality and the upload csv functionality.

# Question 2
Given more time, I would be able to implement the filter by department functionality and reading .csv file functionality.
I would also improve on the css styling.

# Question 3
Implement a choice a field that allows an employee to state the number of times they wish to enter their phone number. I would then display the phone number form according to the number of times that the user had requested.


# Question 4
 I would modify the department field of the Employee model, by removing the list of choices of departments. This will facilitate the employee to fill in whichever new departments they belong to.    

# Question 5
Client-Server response time may arise from a number of issues ranging from hard drive issues to poor database management. I would optimize server response time by optimizing database queries and maintaining a proper schema.  

# Question 6
I enjoyed creating the Employee model because it was pretty straightforward. I also enjoyed styling the welcome page  

# Question 7
Creating and Mapping out the urls of the application was the part that I least enjoyed, because the regex expressions of the urls caused a lot of unexpected errors.
